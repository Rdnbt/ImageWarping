# ImageWarping
This repository involves python program that image process the image/video into the desired geometrical curvature of the windshield. 

## Project breakdown
**1. Image Acquisition:**
    - Loads images and frames from video into OpenCV
    - Converts images to a suitable format
**2. Windshield Geometry Modeling:**
    - Manthematical model/matrix of the windshield's curvature
**3. Image Warping:**
    - Applies transformation based on the windshield model to each pixel
    - OpenCV and Scikit-image for image processing functions.
    - Will consider interpolation techniques (bilinear, bicubic)
**4. TBD**
